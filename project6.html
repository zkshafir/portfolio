<p>Below you can read my reflections followed by <a href="#pic" class="piclink">pictures</a> from the project</p>

       <hr class="line">


         <h2>What did I learn?</h2>

    <p>I was able to use the previous project's group experience in a positive way. The team canvas was very useful this time around.</p>

    <p>I learnt a lot from doing user testing, and getting feedback from previous alumni students.</p>

    <p>Our prototype ended up being quite complicated and it was difficult to understand the double menus. This became very clear once we started testing the solution. </p>

  <h2>What would I change today?</h2>

        <p>I had a good group work experience, and the idea behind the prototype was very nice but perhaps not executed in a clear and concise way. In the end I feel like it became too complicated and difficult to understand.</p>


        <h2>Other Reflections</h2>

     <ul>
                <li>I used a lot of the user feedback we received in the next project where we had to code the solution on our own.</li>
                <li>The project was a good learning experience. It was valuable seeing how something you think is simple might not be as straightforward as you think.</li>
     </ul>
