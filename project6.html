         <h2>What was the project?</h2>

        <p>In this project we worked with user experience design and focused on the interaction between users and user interface. We learned theories, tools and methods of research and testing digital solutions. We had to create an improved version of fronter throughout the process of a design sprint.
            </p>

         <h2>What did I learn?</h2>

        <p>I was able to use the previous project's group experience in a positive way. The team canvas was very useful this time around.</p>

        <p>I learnt a lot from doing user testing, and getting feedback from previous alumni students</p>

        <p>Our prototype ended up being quite complicated and it was difficult to understand the double menus. This became very clear once we started testing the solution. It was a good learning experience seeing how something you think is simple might not be as straightforward as you think.</p>

  <h2>What would I change today?</h2>

        <p>I had a good group work experience, and the idea behind the prototype was very nice but perhaps not executed in a clear and concise way. In the end I feel like it became too complicated and difficult to understand. I used a lot of the user feedback we received in the next project where we had to code the solution on our own. </p>
