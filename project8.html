<p>Below you can read my reflections followed by <a href="#pic" class="piclink">pictures</a> from the project</p>

          <h2>What did I learn?</h2>

        <p>Having already been through a sprint, it went a lot smoother this time around.</p>

        <p>We used our team canvas a lot this time. It was nice to be able to refer back to it every once in a while.</p>

        <p>We did 1 on 1 user tests on the first day of the sprint. This made us rethink the idea of the app and change it from a note-focused app to a task app. </p>

    <h2>What would I change today?</h2>

       <p>The project was finished very late on the 4th day of the sprint so we didn't have a chance to test the prototype before the pitch. This would of course have been useful beforehand. However, we got very good feedback and although we didn't win a star from the teacher the heatmap showed that we got a lot of votes for user friendliness.  </p>
