     <h2>What was the project?</h2>
        <p>This was the final project of the semester. We had to do another design sprint and create a native app that makes study life easier for KEA students. We had to do another design sprint. My group decided to create an organisational task application.</p>


          <h2>What did I learn?</h2>

        <p>It was good to get back to doing a sprint, and it seemed to go a lot smoother this time. I knew what to expect from the sprint which was helpful. </p>

        <p>We used our team canvas a lot this time around, it was nice to be able to refer back to it from time to time.</p>

        <p>We did 1 on 1 user tests on the first day of the sprint, which made us rethink the idea of the app and change it from a notetaking app to a task app. </p>

            <h2>What would I change today?</h2>


       <p>The project was finished very late on the 4th day of the sprint so we didn't have a chance to test the prototype before the pitch. This would of course have been useful beforehand. However, we got very good feedback and although we didn't win a star from the teacher the heatmap showed that we got a lot of votes for user friendliness and the idea behind the app.  </p>
