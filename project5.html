 <p>Below you can read my reflections followed by <a href="#pic" class="piclink">pictures</a> from the project</p>


<hr class="line">

<h2>What did I learn?</h2>

        <p>I got hands-on experience with Premiere Pro and XD. I hadn't done much color grading before and it was good to try that out. Prototyping in XD was great as it helped me later on in the sprint projects.</p>

        <p>My group was very scattered and for the first 3 days I was the only one present. For this reason the Team Canvas wasn't particularly useful as we were well into the project by the time everyone was present to participate. I ended up taking on the role as project manager and in the end it was actually a  valuable  group work experience. It was also helpful for the following group projects.</p>


        <h2>What would I change today?</h2>

        <p>As you can see on the final site the font wasn't implemented, so in the next iteration I would make sure to fix this</p>

        <p>We received some good feedback regarding the film, and there are a few tweaks I would changed based on this. For example, the audio levels aren't quite right.</p>

        <p>We did quite a few user tests, and based on this I can conclude that our target group was pretty accurate as the younger users found the video a lot funnier than the slightly older users. However, this could also be due to the fact that we did user tests in class and the users obviously knew the actors in the film.</p>

        <p>If we had the time I would have spent longer on the storyboard as well. I don't think it clearly communicates each step of the film.</p>
