        <p>01.04.01 Responsive website</p>
<p>Link to site</p>

        <p>I was given the art style “Blue Note”.
There were lots of firsts in this project: first time working from a style tile and first time using HTML and CSS.</p>

        <p>Since this was one of the first projects there are a number of things. I would change should I create another iteration.</p>

        <p>I tried implementing grids in my website, but since I only had one column on most of the pages it wasn’t really used as much as it could have been.  I had attempted to implement the Big Caslon font on the website, but this did not work in the end. In a future iteration I would work on this, as well as try to use grids in a better way than I had done here.</p>

        <p>Below you can see my sketches, style tile and screengrabs from the website. </p>
