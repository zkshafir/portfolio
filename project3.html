        <h2>02.01.02 Simple Animations and 02.03.03 ProjectPool day 1</h2>
<p><a href="http://zoekenndal.dk/animation.html" target="_blank">Link to my simple animation page</a></p>
        <p><a href="http://lea-rose.com/basic-animation/projectpool1/projectpool1.html" target="_blank">Link to my to do list from project pool day 1</a></p>

        <h2>What was the project?</h2>
        <p>I chose to combine these two projects to one page as they both document my javascript learning experience.</p>

        <p>For the simple animation project I was tasked with building a website which included 15 buttons and different animations, styled with CSS, using javascript to control them.</p>

        <p>For the project pool my group decided to create a todo list. The list allows you to add and mark off items.</p>

  <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
        <p>I learnt how to animate using CSS and control my buttons with Javascript.</p>

        <p>I also learnt how to use javascript to control simpler lists.</p>

        <h2>What would I change today?</h2>

 <p>This module was the first time I had really worked with Javascript and it was difficult to wrap my head around. I still struggle with it, but I enjoyed making these simple projects.</p>

        <p>As always I could continue working on the designs forever. I would have liked to design my own character for the simple animation project. If I had more time I would have also styled the to-do list.</p>
