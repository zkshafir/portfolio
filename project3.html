        <p>Below you can read my reflections followed by a <a href="#pic" class="piclink">screengrab</a> from the project</p>

<h2>What did I learn?</h2>

    <p>I learnt how to animate using CSS and control buttons with Javascript.</p>

    <p>Although this was a short and simple project, I felt like I got a lot out of it. It was a good to keep practicing how to use HTML, CSS and now adding Javascript to the mix as well.</p>

<h2>What would I change today?</h2>

 <p>This module was the first time I had really worked with Javascript and it was difficult to wrap my head around. I still struggle with it, but I enjoyed making this simple project.</p>

<p>As always I could continue working on the design forever. I would have liked to design my own character for the simple animation project. </p>
