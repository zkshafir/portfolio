        <h2>What was the project?</h2>

        <p>For the simple animation project I was tasked with building a website which included 15 buttons and different animations, styled with CSS, using javascript to control them.</p>

  <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
        <p>I learnt how to animate using CSS and control my buttons with Javascript.</p>

        <h2>What would I change today?</h2>

 <p>This module was the first time I had really worked with Javascript and it was difficult to wrap my head around. I still struggle with it, but I enjoyed making this simple project.</p>

        <p>As always I could continue working on the design forever. I would have liked to design my own character for the simple animation project. </p>
