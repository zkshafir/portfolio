        <h2>What was the project?</h2>
        <p>The goal of the project was to create a digital, interactive poster of a movie. The sender was Cinemateket and our target group was young adults. My group chose The Shining.
</p>

<p>The interactive poster had to include 3 stages: an opening scene, an interactive middle part and a final result stage.</p>



  <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
        <p>I mainly worked with the design side on this project, and created all the characters for the poster. I worked based on a moodboard, style tile as well as a personas collage. All within the style of the movie. I created a couple of different sprite sheets, although only one was used in the final production.</p>

        <p>The first persona collage I created wasn't specific enough to the person I had created. Based on this feedback I created a second one which contained more creepy images.</p>

        <p>We also worked with user testing and adjusted a few things along the way based on this. For example, that the call to action should be more obvious at the end.</p>



        <h2>What would I change today?</h2>

        <p>The project stays within the style we were aiming for, but isn't particularly interesting. I feel like we could have worked more with the personas collage and created a bigger story.</p>

        <p>The images below are from the presentation day. I created some hanging letters that spell out redrum from one side and murder from the other. </p>

        <p>We also printed out the carpet design on the table and hung up some typewriter sheets with the iconic "All work and no play makes jack a dull boy."</p>
