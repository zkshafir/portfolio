    <p>Below you can read my reflections followed by <a href="#pic" class="piclink">pictures</a> from the project</p>

    <hr class="line">

    <h2>What did I learn?</h2>

    <p>I mainly worked with the design side of this project, and created all the characters for the poster. I worked based on a moodboard, style tile as well as a personas collage. All within the style of the movie: The Shining. I created a couple of different sprite sheets, although only one was used in the final production.</p>

    <p>The first persona collage I created wasn't specific enough to the person I had created. Based on this feedback I created a second collage.</p>

    <p>We also worked with user testing and adjusted a few things along the way based on this. For example, that the call to action should be more obvious at the end.</p>

    <h2>What would I change today?</h2>

    <p>The project stays within the style we were aiming for, but isn't particularly interesting. I feel like we could have worked more with the personas collage and created a bigger story.</p>

    <h2>Other Reflections</h2>

    <p>Being given free rein with the persona collage seemed almost like cheating, as it felt like you could adjust the person to your own wishes. On the other hand, I still ended up having tod to do multiple iterations of the collage, which proves to show it perhaps wasn't as straightforward as I started out thinking.</p>
