<p>Below you can read my reflections followed by <a href="#pic" class="piclink">pictures</a> from the project</p>

<hr class="line">
<h2>What was the project?</h2>
        <p>Based on the previous prototype we had to code a responsive website version.</p>

    <h2>What did I learn?</h2>

        <p>I hadn't coded for a while and it took me some time to get into it again. I learnt that sometimes it's better to start from scratch, as the first iteration was way too complicated. I started over from the beginning and it became much easier.</p>

        <p>The prototype had been perceived as confusing in the user tests. Based on this I decided to simplify and remove one of the menus entirely, which seemed to work a lot better.</p>

     <h2>What would I change today?</h2>

        <p>If I had to redo the website today I would work on the design more. We had to follow the KEA design guide, but my group ended up choosing pastel pinks and purples which seemed to cutesy in the end. I like the simplicity of the site, and would attempt to keep this up as well.</p>


       <h2>Other Reflections</h2>
        <p>I liked the simplicity of the site as well as the menu, which I thought would work well on a portfolio website as well. I ended up taking a few of these elements and using on for this project.</p>
