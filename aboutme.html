    <section>

        <p>I am a Danish/American designer with international roots across the world. I have worked and studied in big and small teams as well as in international settings. </p>

<p>Before KEA I received a bachelors degree in Film and Television Production from the University of Westminster, and subsequently spent the next 3 years as a production designer (or ‘scenograf’ as you Danes like to call it) in the UK and Copenhagen.</p>

<p>These days Copenhagen is back to being my homebase, and I spend my time working and studying at KEA. </p>
